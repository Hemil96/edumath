Contribution
=============
I started writing this module from 05-04-2014. I covered three topics of high school - Matrices, Progression and Vector Algebra. I am constanly working on edumath. If you find this module helpful and wnt to contribute, then you are allow to contribute on github. (http://www.guthub.com/daxeel/edumath)
I request that insert your code in respective section of mathematics topics. So, in future it can be very easy to maintain edumath project.
In next version release i will give credits to all the contributors.

Bug Fixing
===========
If you found any bug in this module then you can edit it by commiting on github. (http://www.guthub.com/daxeel/edumath)
